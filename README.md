# Tammes-problem
This is an executable program for solving classic Tammes problem and the corresponding algorithm is described in the following paper:
Xiangjing Lai, Dong Yue, Jin-Kao Hao, Fred Glover, Zhipeng Lv, Iterated dynamic neighborhood search for packing equal circles on a sphere, Under review, 2022. 

In addition, we provide the best solutions found in this work for all the tested instances. In the following, we provide the graphical representations of the best solutions for two representative instances (N =149 and 150).
